# PlayEarn RPG Protocol

## Project Description

PlayEarn RPG Protocol is a revolutionary blockchain-based role-playing game that combines traditional RPG mechanics with decentralized finance (DeFi) elements. The protocol enables players to create characters, progress through levels by gaining experience, and mint tradeable in-game assets as NFTs. All character progression and asset ownership is secured and verified on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

The game features a comprehensive character progression system where players can level up their characters by gaining experience points, which automatically increases their health, attack, and defense stats. Additionally, players can mint unique in-game assets such as weapons, armor, and special items that provide stat boosts and can be traded with other players on the blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a fully decentralized gaming ecosystem where:

- **Player Ownership**: Players have true ownership of their characters and in-game assets through blockchain technology
- **Play-to-Earn Economy**: Players can earn real value through gameplay, character progression, and asset trading
- **Interoperability**: Characters and assets can potentially be used across multiple games and platforms
- **Community Governance**: Future development decisions driven by token holders and active players
- **Transparent Progression**: All character stats and progression are publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- **Sustainable Gaming**: Creating a gaming economy that rewards skill, time investment, and strategic asset management
